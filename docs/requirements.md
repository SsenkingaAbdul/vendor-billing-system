# Billing System - Software Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The Billing System is a Python-based software solution designed to handle order processing, payment management, and shipping calculations for e-commerce operations.

### 1.2 Scope

## 2. System Features

### 2.1 Order Management
- Create and track orders with UUID-based IDs
- Add/remove items to orders with quantity tracking
- Track order status (PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
- Maintain order history with timestamps and messages
- Calculate order totals including shipping

### 2.2 Vendor Management
- Register vendors with UUID-based IDs
- Track vendor-specific payments
- Associate products with vendors
- Calculate vendor payment distributions

### 2.3 Payment Processing
- Abstract payment gateway interface
- Dummy payment gateway implementation
- Transaction tracking with status updates
- Vendor payment distribution tracking

### 2.4 Shipping Management
- Address validation and formatting
- Country-specific shipping rates
- Base rate + per-item rate calculation
- Multiple country support
- Address component validation

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 System Architecture
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Event-driven status updates
- Extensible payment gateway system
- Configurable shipping calculator

### 3.2 Data Models
#### Order
```python
order_id: UUID
items: List[Item]
total_amount: float
vendor_payments: Dict[str, float]
status: OrderStatus
created_at: datetime
history: List[OrderHistory]
```

#### Item
```python
name: str
price: float
vendor_id: str
quantity: int
item_id: UUID
```

#### Shipping Address
